This comma-separated-value file contains the average latency sustained by small I/Os in microseconds. 
Each value corresponds to a data point test that used a fixed number of outstanding small and large I/Os. 
The number of outstanding small I/Os for a value is specified by its column header in the first row. 
The number of outstanding large I/Os for a value is specified by its row header in the first column.
